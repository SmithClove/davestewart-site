# Nuxt Mentor required

## Overview

I'm an experienced JavaScript and Vue developer who consistently struggles with Nuxt.

Whilst Nuxt touts itself as being "intuitive", I often find it fragile, fickle, and difficult to find the help I need, when I need it.

The bottom line is sometimes it's Nuxt, sometimes it's PEBKAC, but either way it prevents me shipping.

## What I'm looking for

I'm looking for a seasoned Nuxt professional to be available async to advise me when things don't work.

I'm not looking for someone to build features or write code for me, but someone who knows Nuxt back-to-front and could quickly identify a problem, explain the gap in my knowledge, and get me moving again.

Typically, I expect the issues to be around general config, setup, plugin integration, platform and build, etc. My general web, Vue, and TypeScript knowledge is expert, so I'll be able to action what you suggest and won't waste your time. 

Over time, I want to be in a position where Nuxt becomes a friend I can rely on rather than an opponent I wrestle with. 

## How we'll do it

We'll agree a price and a way of working that suits both of us.

As a starter, I see it being a mix of:

- email
- messaging / WhatsApp or Slack
- async video / Loom or [Bubbles](https://www.usebubbles.com/)
- live video / Zoom or GMeet
- screen sharing / [Tuple](https://tuple.app/)

I may also give you access to a repository or two; sometimes it's just easier to run the code!

We would also agree how to respect each other's time; when you would be able to get back to me quickly, and times when async would work better. Of course, I'm open to suggestions and would welcome your thoughts.

## A bit about me

I've been developing web technologies for a long time now, and I've got a pretty decent level of [experience](/bio/). I'm more front end than back end these days; I used to develop PHP back in the day, but now I'm all in on Node, TS, Vue and Nuxt.

I have a lot of [Open Source](/projects/open-source/) projects out there, so I'm used to writing and documenting projects for other people. I think I'm organised, to-the-point, and clear in my communication, and I hope you find that too.

## Think you can help?

Ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dave_stewart) or drop me an [email](mailto:nuxt@davestewart.co.uk?subject=I%20can%20help%20you%20with%20Nuxt) and we can go from there. We could get the conversation going faster if you include a link to your website or bio, and some thoughts about my intro above.

I look forward to hearing from you!
