# The Great Suspender Recovery Tool

## Overview

In early February 2021, Chrome tab manager The Great Suspender was [pulled](http://theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266798/chrome-blocks-the-great-suspender-disabled-malware-tab-recovery) from the Chrome Web Store for containing [malware](https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263).

I responded by writing The Great Suspender Recovery Tool, another Chrome extension, in under 12 hours to attempt to recover users' suspended tabs by searching their browser history and displaying any recovered tabs.

Users can then:

- browse as a nested list or a table
- adjust grouping, sorting and level of detail
- save as folders and bookmarks
- or copy data to spreadsheet
