# Got Paper

## Overview

[Got Paper](https://got-paper.com) is a mobile and desktop app to calculate personal toilet roll usage.

It was created in response to the panic-buying situation that characterised the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic in early 2020.

The application was initially developed in 9 hours, then released within 24 hours on social media. It spread rapidly in round the world with 150K users in the first week, was [featured](https://got-paper.com/press) in national and international press, and [translated](https://got-paper.com/translations)  into 12 languages.

After having mainly accomplished its goal of both raising awareness and providing a useful tool, it has now been [Open Sourced](https://github.com/davestewart/got-paper) so others may either use the codebase as a foundation to develop additional applications quickly, or simply as a learning resource.

See the live site for the [full back story](https://got-paper.com/about).

## Feedback

It was particularly pleasing to see Daily Mail readers so [engaged](https://got-paper.com/press) (or should be <em>enraged</em>?):
