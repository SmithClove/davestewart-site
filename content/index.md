A UK web app developer, currently building [Control Space](/products/control-space).

I'm a colourful mix of technical and creative with a passion for [products](/products/), side [projects](/projects/) and [invention](/archive/projects/).

If you're here for my _work_-work, these days it's [web apps](/work/) and was previously [web sites](/archive/work/) and [animation](/archive/work/animation/).
