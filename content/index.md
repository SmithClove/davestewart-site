I'm a lead developer and indie maker from London, UK.

I'm highly technical with a creative background, and I value good ideas, clean design and tight execution.

So what do I do?

- I'm well-known for my [open source](/projects/)

- I'm currently full time on [product development](/products/)

- Here's my most recent [commercial work](/work/)

- The best older stuff is [archived](/archive/)
 
Feel free to:

- [Contact](/bio/profiles.md) me

- [Search](/search/) the site

- [Read](/blog/) my blog

Cheers!
