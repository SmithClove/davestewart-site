I work mainly in [fintech](/work/) building Vue JS applications, following years of commercial [agency](/archive/work/) work.

I'm most well known for my [open](/projects/open-source/) [source](/archive/projects/tools/) [libraries](/archive/projects/open-source/) and I keep myself fresh with [personal projects](/search/?text=%2Fpersonal&sort=path&view=image).

Right now I'm full time on [consumer products](/products/).
