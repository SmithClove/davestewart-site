A London-based web developer currently building [Control Space](/products/control-space).

I pride myself on a tight mix of technical and creative with a passion for [product](/products/), [innovation](/projects/) and [experimentation](/archive/projects/).

<MediaGallery media="gallery" scale keep-alive />

My commercial work is primarily enterprise [web apps](/work/) after years of agency [sites](/archive/work/) and before that titles [animation](/archive/work/animation/).

I've recently resumed [writing](/blog/) so you can look forward to clear, researched and actionable thinking.
