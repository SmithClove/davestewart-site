A UK web app developer, currently building [Control Space](/products/control-space).

I'm a colourful mix of technical and creative with a passion for [products](/products/), side [projects](/projects/) and [invention](/archive/projects/).

<MediaGallery media="gallery" scale />

If you're here for my _work_-work, these days it's [web apps](/work/) after previously [web sites](/archive/work/) and [animation](/archive/work/animation/).

Also, I've recently restarted [writing](/blog/) which I absolutely love; expect clear, researched and actionable posts.
