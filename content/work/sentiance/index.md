# Sentiance Journeys

## Overview

Sentiance is a data science firm that turns mobile phone sensor data into behavioural insights.

Their "Journeys" app is a data gathering and demo application which automatically creates and visualises behavioral profiles based on activity patterns throughout the day.

I joined the team in Belgium remotely, to help them build out application features.

## Implementation

The application is a [Vue JS](https://vuejs.org/) SPA, built using [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and [D3JS](https://d3js.org/), and powered by a Graph QL back end.

## Detail

It's a while since I looked this project, but I remember I was lucky enough to work with [Jiri Crispeyn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiricrispeyn/) who not only knew the system very well, but was an absolute gun and gave me a great introduction to Bulma and D3JS.

I spent my time building new components, finding and fixing bugs, but also significant effort refactoring and implementing a more scalable architecture having spent the previous couple of years working at [Clear Bank](../clearbank/) and [FairSquare](../fairsquare/).
