# Hello!

I'm a lead developer and indie maker from London, UK.

I'm technical with a creative background, and I value good ideas, tight execution and simple yet effective design.

These days I work full time on my own [products](/products/) and [side projects](/projects/). In the last 5 years I've [worked](/work/) mainly in fintech, building web applications.  Before that, I built Flash and HTML sites for creative agencies, and before that I designed and animated TV titles.

To keep things current, I've moved older projects to the [archive](/archive/) section of the site.

You can find out a bit more about me in the links below.

Enjoy the site!
