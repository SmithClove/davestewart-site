# Engagement

## Skills

I work mainly with [HTML](/tags/html) / [JavaScript](/tags/javascript), [PHP](/tags/php) and [ActionScript](/tags/actionscript), though I work with a pretty healthy amount of languages, frameworks and markups. Whilst learning new technologies does take some commitment when you're busy, I'm pretty proactive in this area.

When it comes to client work I prefer short to medium-term contracts and campaigns, erring towards the more experimental interaction and data-heavy jobs. Recursive structures, [frameworks](http://davestewart.co.uk/category/frameworks/), [Regular Expressions](/tags/regexp "Double-O") and [text-processing](http://www.xjsfl.com/support/api/elements/selectors) play towards my strengths.

I thrive on joining the creative and technical dots, and especially the cross-pollination of techniques or technologies. I'm also a stickler for detail - I simply don't see the point in making something "good" when a little extra inspiration, research and effort will push something over into "great".

The work on this site reflects only a small fraction of the jobs I've taken on over the years, but is representative of the type of work I enjoy most.

## Open Source

My Open Source work can be found at [davestewart.io](http://davestewart.io).

## Engagement

Depending on the project size and scope, I'm happy to take projects on myself, or work within a team, by direct-hire or via recruiters.
