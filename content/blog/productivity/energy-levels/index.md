# Mirror your body's energy levels to get more done

## Into

I recently wrote a post on optimising daily productivity, and part of it touched on being mindful of energy levels throughout the day, and matching your tasks and effort to them.

Experiment

- try getting up earlier
- try relaxing in the evening
- pick a hobby or something else to do
- have a cutoff time
- get into cooking
- reward yourself with a box set or a film
- step out of your comfort zone and change it up
- try working somewhere else
- change your office around

What are the costs to being productive when you are?

- time away from family
- always working
- working "for free"

What are your goals?

Strategies:

- napping
- structured procrastination
