# 100 actionable hacks to boost your productivity 

## Preamble

I've spent the last year or so fine-tuning my productivity strategies, and it's come time to share.

This article is not a rehash of existing productivity methodologies you will have seen elsewhere, nor does it deep dive into specific areas like scheduling, email management or exercise.

What this article is, is a list of small changes I've made in the last few years **that** have worked to conquer some of my worst habits and allowed me to get much more out of my day.

## Contents

There's about 80 tips in this article, and they are ***coloured red***. You can just read them if you want, and read the notes on the ones that resonate with you.

## Context

I'm going to cover techniques I've learned, observed or invented, some of which are direct as in "plan your work" but many which are *indirect*; for example there are sections on energy levels and sleep hygiene.

Additionally, many of the tips are born of *mindfulness*; that is, analysing my own effectiveness throughout the day and being honest about what works and where I'm falling short. It's a technique everyone should use, and as you read the tips below, I encourage you to think about your day and look behind, to the side, and around the surface reasons when your effectiveness is lacking.

This is a new paragraph

The other thing to note is that I believe being productive has its foundations in willpower, and anyone committed to being effective should commit to getting a handle on this; we are all human of course, but you must *get better at getting better!*

To provide a little context before we get started, my situation is:

  - I'm a long-term freelance web developer, now Indie Hacker
  - I work full-time from home on one main project and occasional side / client work
  - I have my own flat, with enough funds to live comfortably
  - I'm a single guy, with no kids or major commitments
  - I'm writing this article for past me, present me and future me.

I hope – even if your situation is different from mine – that most of the tips are useful to you.

YMMV!

## Work

With side projects it can be hard to 

### Project management

> This is a small note

***Manage your project like your work:*** I'd noticed that I seemed to get much more done at work vs home, so I simply adopted the same strategies and tools. Note that this was the single biggest change to forward momentum since finding myself floundering when the project moved from small to medium sized.

***Plan your roadmap:*** it is much easier to refer to a feature plan and tick items off on a checklist than to just “write code and hope you get something done”. You can also link related features, which is really useful.

***Plan your features:*** If

### Time management

***Use lists:*** with tasks spread out over email, Jira, Trello, etc, it helps to have a single place to look. 

***An 8 hour day often isn't:*** it's tempting to think you have 8 hours to get the work done, but that often isn't true; meetings, breaks, etc.

If you think a task is going to take you 8 hours, then you'll either be working into the night or taking more than a day to complete it, and that could mean disappointing a client or just pushing everything else back so you end the week on the back foot.

***Estimate pessimistically:*** it can be tempting to add lots of tasks to the day's to-do list, but they'll either not get done, or you'll work into the wee hours to get them done. Sure you can work longer to get the work done, but 

## Momentum

### Get the work done

***Get the small tasks out of the way:*** you may have heard of "eat the frog" but ticking off a bunch of &lt; 2 minute tasks first thing is a great way to get you in the rhythm for the day, and prevents a big task from taking over first thing.

Additionally, by chipping away at the small things, you prevent a gradual build up of stress and that overwhelming feeling that you have "too much to do"

***Start that task:*** honestly, give yourself 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes, 20 minutes. It won't be as bad as you think it is, and the longer you spend on it, the more likely stuff will start making sense and you'll stick with it.

***Make a start:*** it's easy to mentally build up the stress of starting something new in your mind – and sure – the first 1, 2, 5, 30 minutes may be... but won't be once you hit those thresholds. No matter what the task is, try to figure out a way to get into it, for example reading the docs, fixing some bugs, or *just getting on with it*. Usually the imagined stress is far, far worse than the actual task, then you kick yourself for wasting all that time avoiding it.

***Do the hard work:*** 

### Mental blocks

***Break it down:*** it's hard to know what to get done when you don't know where you're going. Spend some time (5 - 15 mins) imagining the next planned feature through start to finish, and write some bulleted sections on how you'll slice that elephant. I have two approaches for this

  - I find [WorkFlowy](https://workflowy.com) brilliant for this.
  - GitHub

***Draw it:*** if you're stuck on a problem and you're just looking at code, it might be time to think of the problem in a different way:

  - Architectural problems can be solved with flowcharts, boxes and arrows.
  - UI problems can be solved by quickly drawing screens and UI elements as boxes and squiggles.
  - I once solved a complex sorting algorithm by laying out and physically rearranging coloured post it notes on my desk!

I generally start with pen and paper, then usually progress to Balsamic and Whimsical.

***Get away from it:*** the last thing I want to do when getting stuck on a problem is go do something unrelated because it feels like wasting time: but often this exactly what is needed to free your mind, get some perspective, and have new ideas present themselves. If you really don't want to just walk, take a pen and pad and find an alternative environment (park, coffee shop or such like) to sit down and scribble in.

***Sleep on it:*** don't be tempted to grind away

### Motivation

***Notice changing energy levels:*** then tailor the work you to do those times.

For example, I try to write complex algorithms soon after I start work as I feel rested and alert and the ideas are still fresh from the day before. But mid-afternoon I sometimes feel distracted so I save easy tasks like catching up with emails for those times.

  - Be aware that of energy levels, and age
  - Working into the night: 

***Give yourself a pep-talk:*** go on - there's no one around, so talk out loud to yourself and remind yourself why you're doing this, what the vision is, what the cost for procrastinating is, or whatever you need to do to gee yourself up and get on with it.

### Stay out of the weeds

***Perfect is the enemy of done:*** if your deadlines are self-imposed it can be easy to want to get something perfect, but this comes at the cost of overall project momentum.

***Make it work, make it right, make it fast:*** a programmer maxim to ensure you don't waste time optimising details that don't matter yet, and might change or simply never be needed. 

***Say it straight then say it great:*** this is a technique [Tim </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA&t=481s">Ferr</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA&t=481s">is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFdR8w_R1HA&t=481s) uses when writing; he suggests to get the facts down then improve the prose and say it more cleverly and cleanly later, so you get the 80% done before the 20%.

### Don't take on too much

***Beware feature creep:*** do you really need that feature now? Maybe it's better to write a ticket and throw it in the backlog. You can do it when you need it, or if you get the boring stuff done, build it as a reward!

***Beware additional projects:*** it always seems like it won't take long, but we forget that the devil is in the details, or complication increases exponentially.

***No capes:*** This is a line from the movie The Incredibles where Mr Incredible describes to Edna Mode the kind of suit he wants. Edna hilariously illustrates to him that whilst capes look fancy, [they invariably lead to downfall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YL3w73MAuIM).

It's the same with many fancy features; they might sound cool when you **think** them up, but invariably they'll take ages, lead to myriad related problems, and slow you down.

Recognise when an idea is a *cape*, yell "No capes!", and move on.  

## Effectiveness

### Process

***Build positive processes:*** you get up on time, you 

  - We intrinsically know what this is 
  - The positive process gives you more options;

***Avoid negative process:*** you lie in bed, you're late, you don't shower, you drink more tea, you surf the internet, etc, etc. You ultimately feel bad you didn't do what you wanted to do what you wanted. Some examples are:

  - **scrolling social media** before getting out of bed, so you stay in bed an extra 45 minutes; instead, just get up
  - **turning the telly** on whilst having breakfast, which sucks you in to the next daytime program; instead, write notes, or do a brain quiz
  - **making a cup of tea** as soon as you get up, so you delay your shower until you've drunk it; instead, boil the kettle but have one after
  - **checking email** immediately after showering, which delays you getting dressed un the afternoon; instead, just get dressed

***Audit your process:*** 

### Showing up

***Get up on time:*** 

***Get dressed:*** don't miss meetings, don't be late, etc

### Your calendar is your friend

***Put it in the diary:*** 

***Review today's calendar:*** 

***Review tomorrow's calendar:***  

### Get better at timekeeping

***Work backwards:*** 

***Keep a checklist:*** 

***Do it now:*** 

## Distractions

This is the killer for most people

### Procrastination

***Be mindful of your weak spots:*** it's easy to waste the morning doing something pseudo-productive like surfing YouTube or Wikipedia. The first step is just to be aware of this, then you can catch yourself in the act. Try to recognise *when* you do this too, such as after just getting up or after lunch (see the section on [energy levels](#energy-levels)) and preempt accordingly.

***Keep a "distractions inbox" :*** when you get a great idea, or remember something that suddenly needs to be done now (but of course doesn't really) use your list app to make a note of it, and come back to it later. Don't let distractions send you off course!

### Consuming content

***Use 80/20 to listen to podcasts:*** use 20% of your concentration when listening to podcasts. You don't need to hear every word – if you miss something, rewind. The other 80% of your concentration should be getting on with the work.

***Avoid the Internet during deadlines:*** not just because concentrating on two things at once is hard, but because companies like YouTube and Spotify put in a lot of effort to keep you on their platforms, and before you know it you'll have wasted a couple of hours on something that isn't important right now.

***Make housework time, podcast time:*** turn "wasted" time into "productive" time by listening to a podcast on business, entrepreneurship or Indie Hacking as you do something non-work related like cooking, tidying, hoovering, or ironing: you kill two birds with one stone: what was boring is now interesting, and what was concentration-sapping now doesn't matter!

### Media addiction

***Pretend you're actually at work:*** you wouldn't check Facebook / Twitter / Discord / personal email / phone at work because it would be unprofessional. Foster the same professional mindset for your own work, and check it at lunchtime or in breaks only.

***Turn off notifications:*** I have this as a rule for life, not just work. The last thing you need when trying to move forward is your phone's apps and group chats attempting to shift your attention from the task at hand. Turn your notifications off and commit to checking your phone once an hour, rather than every 2 minutes.

***Turn off your phone:*** if you really can't break the addiction to checking your phone (and I definitely suffer from this from time to time) the easy answer is to physically turn it off, at least for several hours at a time. Trust me, you will feel like a right idiot when you go to pick up an inert black brick every 2 minutes and you'll quickly learn not to!

### Device addition

***Beware slippery slopes:*** For example checking your phone each time someone leaves the room

***Free yourself from social media/emails/phone:*** as 

## Environment

### Work setup

***Have a separate space for work:*** if you have the luxury, have your work setup in a separate room

***Invest in external screens:*** if you work on a laptop and you haven't already, the extra real estate will allow you to work on related tasks at the same time, rather than losing time hunting and switching through applications and windows.

***Use monitor stands:*** it really helps to have your monitor(s) at eye height: it makes a huge difference to posture and wellbeing vs hunching over a laptop sitting right down on the desk. Also, ignore 

### Keep it tidy

> This has traditionally been a tough one for me, as my workaholic tendencies tend to mean that I don't multitask, outside of the work


***Keep a clear desk:*** so you are not constantly distracted. Not only is it amazing how effective this is, but a cluttered desk is a tell-tale for feeling overwhelmed. I tend to put stuff into a pile and put it out of sight, then will check in with it when I have time (usually once every few weeks or when it gets big enough).

***Do your chores:*** get used to washing up / putting things away / hanging out the washing / taking out the rubbish – this way your home environment won't drag you down, make you feel stressed, and ultimately take time away from other tasks.

***Declutter:*** much easier to be productive if you know everything else is done. The spare room, the filing, the garage, whatever it is probably won

### Keep on top of things

***Use dead time:*** 2 minutes to boil; don't check your phone, rather clear the dishwasher

***Don't let tasks build up:*** a stitch in time saves 9 (otherwise it builds up)

***Do things before time:***  laundry, shopping, washing up

### Quality of life

***Use the right kit:*** Set in place things that provide value / options 

  - Cheap laptop for lounge or kitchen for music, recipes, etc
  - Good speakers on your computer for higher fidelity music
  - Good wireless headphones to shut yourself off from it all
  - Google Home to get you up, read you the news, ask questions
  - Crumb catcher breadboard so I'm not constantly sweeping the kitchen floor

## Routine

### Getting up

***Get up earlier:*** many people swear by the extra hours they gain to get tasks done, and actually not that hard once you are in a rhythm (see next section).

***Don't hit snooze:*** a

***Skip the scroll:*** checking your mobile is bad for a couple of reasons: 1) before you know it, you'll be scrolling social media, watching videos, or reading articles, and this can critically derail your morning routine 2) by starting the day with distractions you are effectively programming your brain to say "this is the standard I'm setting for myself" and that is a very slippery slope to begin the day on

### Starting the day

***Make your bed:*** sounds stupid, but you're symbolically drawing a line that sleep is over. It takes literally 20 seconds to straighten the covers, and has a strange kind of cumulative benefit.

And when you return to bed at night you'll feel thankful to see a lovely inviting bed, and climbing into it will feel like a privilege, not a chore, to end the day on. Additionally, guys, girls just love a made bed, so free brownie points!

***Drink a glass of water:***  a

***Do at least a tiny amount of exercise:*** I find exercise really boring, but I find 30 seconds (between taking my towel off and getting into the shower if you must know!) to do 20 pushups. It might not sound like much, but if I do that every day it's 7300 push ups a year! If you have more time, there are loads of [5, 7 and 10 minute workouts](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=short+workout) on YouTube.

### Routine

***Morning routine:*** 

***Take a break:*** mine is going to get a nice coffee, then optionally walking via the common on the way there or back: adds about 20-30 mins to the journey but I feel like I’ve got some sun and fresh air and by the time I get back I am refreshed and ready to go again.

***Change it up:*** take some time to do some work elsewhere

### Food

***Have food for the week:*** I tend to go shopping on Monday morning as it's a nice way to ease myself into the week, and I avoid the rush of shoppers at the weekend. If Monday is too busy for you, go on Sunday afternoon.

***Eat better snacks:*** I used to spend my days eating chocolate biscuits, but these days have switched to apples, hummus, nuts

***Eat better meals:*** use something like Mindful Chef

***Allow yourself treats:*** there's nothing wrong with having a pack of biscuits in the cupboard, a bottle of wine in the fridge or some ice cream in the freezer, *just make sure it's not your go-to!* 

### Time away from work

***Find time to relax:*** 

***Find time for hobbies:*** 

***Wind-down before bed:*** read a book, watch TV: this is the number one thing that works for me when I'm working right up until bed time and sometimes have trouble getting to sleep or maintaining a good sleep. Don't be tempted to check your mobile or doom-scroll social media: remember, you are in control, not your phone.

### Going to bed

***Have a regular bedtime:*** 

***Consider going to bed earlier:*** for me this was actually counter-intuitive. If I go to bed earlier and get up earlier, how am I saving time? Answer: it's not the amount of waking time but the quality of waking time. Although this wasn't a problem in my 20s (I loved to work till 2, 3, 4am!) as I've got older I've noticed that when I can concentrate has changed considerably. By going bed earlier I'm to

***Review tomorrow's calendar:*** this is

***Keep your phone downstairs:*** I'm split on this one as my phone actually

### Sleeping

***Keep a pad near the bed:*** so you can dump any nagging thoughts should you have them. Failing that use your phone, but you know what they say about screens in bed.

***Use ear plugs;*** if you really need to sleep, consider using ear plugs. The good ones are quite comfy, and it's amazing the effect it has – as they expand in your ear, it's like someone turning the volume down on the world and you end up in complete silence

***Have good sleep hygiene:*** [https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene](https://sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene)

## Conclusion

Many of the lifestyle changes (exercise, food) I've only made in the last year, but I wish I'd done them years ago.

I know this all seems quite prescriptive, but it works for me.

Final answer: know thyself

Hope that helps!
