# Things I got better at

## Overview

On learning, mind shifts and hacks

Not just tech.


Mind shifts

Last 10 years; some new, some old.

Can learn new skills; just need to go online and research.

Can get better at things; need to be mindful (by which I mean, reflect on how you feel, and be honest about the outcome and consequences) and learn from your mistakes.

## Personal

### Well-being and happiness

Lorem ipsum

- ***Stopping biting my nails***

  I've bitten my nails my whole life and always hated the fact I can't stop and I can't help myself.

  But two years ago I stopped overnight, and aside from a few slip-ups I now have perfect nails that I don't feel the temptation to bite. It was such a momentous change for me, that I wrote all about it [here](/blog/nail-biting/).

- ***Leaving my phone alone***

  Like most other humans I'm not immune from the dopamine hit one gets from checking their phone.

  But I've learned to recognise the signs – such as having to look something up, needing to check for updates, or scrolling for the next story / article / video / comment – and now channel that energy elsewhere.

  I won't check my phone at dinner, won't scroll social media whilst watching a film, won't take it out of my pocket in conversation, and if I realise I'm wasting time on it, will put it away and do something else.

## Organisation

### Time management

Lorem ipsum

- _**Deciding quickly**_

  I used to be that person who would always "have to get back to you" but found rather than giving me freedom the swirling soup of "maybes" was a constant source of stress; events would come out of nowhere, and I had an increasing sense of being seen as unreliable and under-prepared.

  These days I make decisions quickly; it's less stress overall, and everyone knows where they are.

- ***Using aide memoires***

  Specifically I mean calendars and shopping lists (vs todo lists or such like).

- ***Teaching myself accountancy***

  It has always frustrated and amazed me that as a self-employed programmer, I don't understand accountancy.

  I am currently in the middle of my journey to learn everything I need to know to become proficient in bookkeeping, accounts and taxation, and I can understand now why it is such an alien language to non-accountants.

- ***Doing a business course***

  As an "Indie Hacker" it always frustrated me that I never understood "business"; what it was, what it entailed, how others just seemed to know

  In 2020, I took the London Business School's [Entrepreneurial Edge](https://www.london.edu/executive-education/online-courses/the-entrepreneurial-edge) three month online course.


- ***Learning how to dress***

  Lorem ipsum

### Trivial

Lorem ipsum

- ***Understanding the boiler / thermostat settings so I don't waste money***

  How does the dial on the thermostat relate to the dial on the boiler?

  Well, the two work **together** to regulate the temperature:

  - the dial on the boiler defines "heating" and "cooling" periods, i.e. times the boiler *can* be on, or **will** be off
  - The dial on the thermostat sets a target **room** temperature, asking the boiler to heat the radiators if too cold

- ***Reading a street map in a moving car, so we don't get lost***

  Admittedly, this was 20 years ago, but I would always lose track of the streets, and we'd end up lost! For me the missing step was to count **up** the side streets on the map, then count **down** the side streets as you drive.
