# My ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting journey

**TL;DR** - you eat really well, will lose weight, it's not that difficult and there are many surprising yet indirect benefits

## Background

Motivation

- Girlfriend had weight loss goals, was moving in, and we fancied a bit of a reset / challenge
- A doctor friend had recommended it, was going to start at the same time, and gave us loads of advice
- It just seemed like good timing

History

- Generally eat sensibly, but a lot of bread, pasta, biscuits, etc
- Was beginning to feel bit flabby, thought it would be interesting to see if I could shift it
- Had unrealised intentions to get fit, so this seemed like a natural partner to that

Target

- Aim to lose 10 kg (arbitrary number; no idea what that would look like or if realistic)
- Aimed for 3 months (long enough to seriously commit but not too long to become nebulous)
- Started with Keto then added Intermittent Fasting when we got used to it
- Additional exercise to burn the excess calories

Worries

- Will it get boring
- Will I stick to it
- What if it doesn't work

## Overview

> Keto and intermittent fasting are incredibly complimentary, and the end result is more than the sum of its parts

### What is the Ketogenic Diet (Keto)?

Overview

- < 50g carbs (keto), <20g carbs per day (extreme, but entirely achievable)
- Replace majority carbs with majority fats (body will burn them) and protein (fills you up)
- Body switches from burning carbs to ketones
- Like a Prius switching from fuel you put in to running down its internal battery 

What you can and can't eat

- Don't eat
  - Long list (anything wheat based, starchy veg or fruit, sugary anything)
- Do eat
  - Long list (meat, daily, eggs, green veg, nuts, avocado, berries)

Results

- Can lose 1kg per week easily, sometimes .3kg per day
- Supplement with intermittent fasting

### What is Intermittent Fasting?

Overview

- It helps you attain a calorie defecit (you burn more calories than you consume)
- Recommended calorie intakes are 2500 calories for men and 2000 calories for women
- We aimed to eat < 1000 calories a day, which is perfectly possible
- You'll see a lot of ratios; i.e. 5:2, 16:8, etc
  - 5:2 means you fast on the weekdays (5) and eat normally at the weekend (2)
  - 16:8 means you fast for 16 hours and eat for 8 (usually between 12 midday and 8 in the evening)

- Fasting means no food, but you can drink water and unsweetened tea and coffee

This really helped our weight loss, in fact we did it full time for a couple of months and it was no problem, especially since we were already used to not feeling hungry on Keto.

## Our journey

### Preparation

What you need to win

- Be committed; stick to the programme and see the results!
- Be organised; shop ahead to make sure you have options
- Be detail oriented; read and understand the labels

Getting ready

- Clear out cupboards and fridge of bad foods
- Organise the fridge so you know what is where
- Buy and read books for both nutrition and recipe info
- Created spreadsheets of macros and recipes and meal plans
- Sign up to Green Chef to do the thinking and shopping for evening meals for us

How we approached it

- Made list of allowed ingredients + macros (how many carbs, fat, etc)
- Gathered recipes from internet and books
- Began counting macros on bought ingredients
- Changed from cow's milk to almond milk
- Green Chef Keto box

### Planning

Process

- Keto for 3 months
- Intermittent fasting from 1 month in
- Planned and scheduled meals and snacks
- Willpower (i.e. not eating too much, snacking too much, drinking wine)
- Regular exercise

Meal planning

- First month only until we got used to it
- Planned the week's snacks and meals then printed it out

### Routine

Weekly routine

- For the first month, plan the week's meals and snacks on Sunday morning
- Shop on Sunday afternoon (mani meals)
- Prepare cooked snacks on Sunday evening
- Shopping trip on Monday mornings (snacks)

Daily routine

- First thing

  - Wake up any time from 6:30 – 8pm

  - Wee + poo

  - Weigh yourself
  - Take a shower

  - Drink water, have a tea (after the weigh-in!)


- Morning
  - Empty the draining rack, dishwasher
  - Coffee and tea in the morning
  - Snack around 10am if not intermittent fasting

- Day
  - Lunch at 12 or 1
  - Wash up
  - More tea and coffee
  - Snack at 3 or 4
- Evening
  - Dinner at 6 or 7
  - Wash up
  - Chill or bit of work from 8 – 10:30
  - Bed by 10:30 to 11:30


### Food

What we did eat

- Breakfast - eggs bacon, avocado, coffee
- Lunch - mainly raw food like olives, ham, tomatoes, etc
- Snacks - this and that
- Dinner - Green Chef

Extra tips

- Mix of milks
- Cauliflower soup
- Nuts, sun-dried tomatoes. olives, cheese
- Eggs, eggs, eggs
- Work out which ready-made food is ok
- Blueberries, raspberries rather than chocolate or sweets
- Yoghurt, berries, granola, chocolate
- Cauliflower soup; quick and easy to make and delicious
- Use protein shakes when you are in a hurry
- Keto bread (expensive, but a nice treat)
- Chinese lettuce great for wraps
- 1g keto wraps
- Occasional keto treats, brownies, etc

Strategies

- What to eat whilst out
- Make sure you always have food at home
- More difficult to eat on the fly, especially things like snacks; you notice how almost everything is carb-based (sandwiches, crisps, pies, pasta, etc) but the deli aisle is your friend (cooked meats, cheese, olives, salads, etc)
- Listen to music or podcasts when you cook so you improve your brain and waistline!

Making it fun

- Have friends round for Keto dinners
- Research imaginative recipes

Wins

- It's great when you hit the next weight category

Gotchas

- Milk has too many calories, almond is the best, always pick unsweetened
- Embrace the change (i.e. berries) rather than trying to substitute (i.e. brownies) for it
- Keep an eye on calories; don't overdo it on the snacks, cheese, etc

### Progress

How we measured

- weigh in each day, first thing in the morning, underwear only (FYI, clothes weigh about 500g)
- Make sure you pee (could be a litre of liquid so 1kg weight)
- Taking a dump can be another few hundred grams!
- Keto strips at the start, but if you walk the walk, you will be in ketosis
- Keto blood tests, but not really needed
- Bad breath! On keto it's absolutely killer in the morning; like fermented dairy and meat :(

How things changed over time

- Very regimented at the start, constantly checking ingredients
- Planned every meal for the first month, worked more on the fly as we went forward
- Green Chef was an absolute life-saver

Roadblocks

- Plateauing – about 6 weeks in, we noticed that the weight loss had slowed down, or even stopped. This is when we added Intermittent Fasting; first as an experiment (too busy to eat) then as a strategy (this really works!)
- Exercise – it really helps to burn more calories than you are taking in

Making mistakes

- Going out of ketosis is easy if you're careless
- Don't have a full-milk latte on the way to work!
- Be careful with sauces, condiments, fizzy drinks, cocktail mixers, etc
- Getting back into it can take a day or two, but intermittent fasting will get you there quicker

### Day to day

Thoughts on food

- You can get a bit bored with the snacks (so step back and get creative)
- Drink lots of tea and coffee, water

How your body reacts

- You don't feel hungry
- Poos are few and far between, it can be as much as 3 or 4 days without going!
- Your breath smells

How things changed

- Became extremely regimented with planning, making and eating meals
- Got very used to cooking and washing up (actually a benefit)
- Gained knowledge around calories and macros

Cheating and breaks

- Going out with friends (you can eat most dishes, ask to substitute chips for salad, or leave some)
- Try not to make silly mistakes (everything has sugar!)
- Drinking (whisky) is fine, but cocktails like Negroni will not
- Cheating (internment fasting will get you back in ketosis)
- Taking a break (just enjoy it for what it is)

## Review

### Benefits

Real benefits

- Lost 10kg, went down 2 inches on waist – even look good in skinny jeans aged 48!
- Enjoyed cooking – the time out, recipe box makes it easy
- Actually, very straightforward

Hidden benefits

- Intermittent fasting
  - Cook early, go to bed early, get up early
  - Get a routine, make the most of your time in the evening
  - You really appreciate food when you eat!
- Keto
  - Begin to understand nutrition
  - Understand how dependent you are on carbs
  - Far more considered in shopping choices
- Cooking
  - Get used to cooking, washing up, putting away, keeping the place tidy
  - Get better at shopping, food choices, making sure you don't run out
  - Afterwards, appreciate the foods you missed, and understand where you were abusing food

What I loved

- We ate like kings; no doubt about it
- Green Chef has brilliant recipes

Downside

- Life felt very project-oriented to start with
- Caused tension with me being very focused and girlfriend being more likely to stray from the path
- More difficult to eat on the fly, especially things like snacks; you notice how almost everything is carb-based (sandwiches, crisps, pies, pasta, etc) but the deli aisle is your friend (cooked meats, cheese, olives, salads, etc)
- It is more expensive; bread, milk alternative, eggs (shortage in the UK!), olives, etc
- Lost too much weight on legs, have started exercising again

Other thoughts

- I think doing it as a couple was easier; there is a lot of cooking and washing upland having someone to share the burden with is really helpful

### Thoughts on food

What I missed

- pastries (only at the start)
- Chinese food

What I didn't miss

- chocolate biscuits
- bread
- pasta

What felt overrated when I finally tried it

- White bread – actually felt blocked and bloated when I did eat it! Now, don't want to get into the habit again
- Pizza; no pizza is better than bad pizza, and good pizza is rare to find

## What next?

Now

- Back to sensible eating, but more of a low-carb diet
- The weight has stayed off since hitting my target two months ago (I'm still 80kg)

- Won't just be making pasta every night, actually have stuck to Green Chef keto

- Staying away from really carby food – I just don't really like it now, and I understand the costs of eating it

- I generally eat less now, and am more mindful of what I buy

Going forwards

- Need to come up with some sensible snacks to eat; have to watch I don't just eat cheese the whole time

- Trying not to slip into bad habits like biscuits, etc

- Will use Keto and intermittent fasting as a tool
