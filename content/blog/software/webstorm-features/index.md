# An intro to WebStorm's most powerful features 

## Intro

WebStorm is without doubt the most powerful web development IDE there is. Yes, many people like VSCode, and whilst it has some great features, a comparison between a text editor and an IDE is like comparing `console.log()` to opening the DevTools panel.

See my other article on WebStorm's [keyboard shortcuts](/blog/webstorm-shortcuts/) to get the complete lowdown on using WebStorm to transform your experience of writing, running and debugging your code and applications.

## Editing

WebStorm's code editing support is second to none, and in many cases, like magic:

- ***Intentions***

  `Opt`+`Enter` on any code or markup member to get a list of things you can do

- ***Automatic imports***

  Type the symbol name, hit `Tab` and the imports are created for you

- ***Multiple selection and cursor-fu***

  Extremely powerful ways to select and manipulate multiple blocks of text at the same time

- ***Find and replace***

  Can edit code directly in results window

- ***Live templates and postfix notation***

  Set up templates to expand code, e.g. type `fori`+`Tab` and get a for loop with placeholders

- ***HTML editing***

  Lots of little things to help you out, like adding quotes for attributes automatically

- ***Language injection***

  WebStorm recognises languages across and within domains and navigates as such


## Navigation

It's incredibly easy and intuitive to move round

- ***Code hyperlinking***

  `Cmd`+`Click` any keyword to navigate to the source (works in code and markup)
 
- ***Find usages***

  `Cmd`+`Click` on a declaration to see all usages, or right click on files to see the same
  
- ***Recent files***

  Jump back to any file
 
- ***Filter lists***

  Just start typing to filter a list
 
- ***Navigate to***

  `Shift`+`Cmd`+`O` to go to anything instantly
 
- ***Find anything***

  `Shift`+`Shift` lets you find anything

- ***Project scopes***

  Filter the project tree based on criteria, so you're not overwhelmed

## Tooling

Because WebStorm is an IDE, it knows way more about your code that you do:

- ***Sources roots***

  Mark folders as sources and have path autocomplete pick up on those folders
 
- ***Refactoring***

  Powerful refactoring tools for code and files across all languages
 
- ***Node debugging***

  Debug scripts then add breakpoints to stop, inspect and change your code
 
- ***Git integration***

  Files show what has been edited, Shelve change sets for later, built in Git
 
- ***Package and dependency management***

  Run NPM scripts from a panel and jump directly to packages from the JSON
 
- ***Additional web development tools***

  Database, JSON Path, Regular Expressions, HTTP Client
