# Modular site architecture with Nuxt layers

## Intro

Nuxt 3 introduces a new paradigm called "Layers" that the docs describe as "[a powerful system that allows you to extend the default files, configs, and much more](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers)". Whilst this explanation is _technically_ accurate, the emphasis on "extending defaults" overlooks another perhaps more impactful use case ‚Äì that of logically reorganising your application.

### Overview

To get you up-to-speed on the concepts, I'll begin with some theory:

- [Site organisation](#site-organisation)<br>
  A comparison of organising by concern vs by domain
- [Nuxt layers intro](#nuxt-layers-intro)<br>
  A brief intro to Nuxt layers and how they work

Then, I'll share actionable steps to migrate an existing Nuxt application: 

- [Nuxt concerns](#nuxt-concerns)<br>
  How individual Nuxt concerns work or need to be reconfigured when moved to layers
- [Site migration](#site-migration)<br>
  Advice and steps to successfully migrate your own Nuxt 3 site to layers
- [Demo](#demo)<br>
  A demo repo with tagged commits following a layers migration

You might also want to skim the official Layers docs before continuing:

- [Guide ¬ª Authoring Nuxt Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers)

### Contents

It's a long article (!) so here's the full table of contents if you want to skip:

<NavToc type="list"
        exclude="intro"
        prompt=""
/>

## Site organisation

Let's take a look at two main ways to organise sites and apps; by [concern](#by-concern) and by [domain](#by-domain).

> Note that the choice of words "domain" and "concern" could easily be "feature" and "responsibility".
>
> *Feel free to use whatever terms make the most sense to you.*

### By concern

Most Vue and Nuxt projects are born of simple starter templates, which group files by *concern* (`pages`, `components`, etc):

```
+- src
    +- components
    |   +- blog
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- home
    |       +- ...
    +- content
    |   +- blog
    |       +- ...
    +- pages
    |   +- blog.vue
    |   +- index.vue
    +- ...
```

This folder structure is simple to understand and somewhat invisible when your site or application is small.

However, as sites grow in size, this grouping obfuscates more *natural* relationships (i.e. everything related to `blog`) which makes it hard to understand what your site or application actually *does*.

### By domain

At a certain size of site (and actually, not that big!) it becomes more intuitive to silo files by *domain* (`blog`, `home`, etc):

```
+- src
    +- blog
    |   +- components
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- content
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- pages
    |       +- blog.vue
    +- home
    |   +- components
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- pages
    |       +- index.vue
    +- ...
```

Transposing physical locations has tangible benefits...

File management:

- domains (`blog`, `home`, etc) become self-contained units
- related code will generally be located in a sibling folder
- less open folders / scrolling / jumping in your IDE

Configuration and settings:

- domain config is discrete from from global config
- simpler, smaller, domain entry points, rather than one huge config file
- minimal mixing of global and local concerns

Developer experience:

- PRs are simpler as most files will exist downstream from a common folder
- you can more easily develop new features or site sections
- you can more easily turn complete features on / off
- domains can be broken out further if they get too large

The conceptual shift from concern to domain may feel familiar to you [if you moved](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/composition-api-faq.html#more-flexible-code-organization) from Vue's Options API to the Composition API; rather than concerns being striped across a sprawling `options` structure, they can be more naturally grouped as composables.

##  Nuxt layers intro

So it turns out that Nuxt Layers are perfect to restructure and reorganise a site by domain.

Layers can be viewed as "mini" applications which are stitched together to create the "full" application.

Each folder:

- may contain `pages`, `components`, `server` sub-folders, etc
- identifies it's a layer using a `nuxt.config.ts` file

A small personal site might be organised as follows:

```
+- src
    +- base                          <-- global, shared or one-off functionality
    |   +- ...
    +- blog                          <-- nuxt content configuration, markdown articles
    |   +- ...
    +- home                          <-- one-off components, animation plugin and configuration
    |   +- components
    |   |   +- Hero.vue
    |   |   +- Services.vue
    |   |   +- Testimonials.vue
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- pages
    |   |   +- index.vue
    |   +- plugins
    |   |   +- ...
    |   +- nuxt.config.ts
    +- ...
    +- nuxt.config.ts 
```

The top-level layers silo related `pages`, `components`, `plugins`, even `config`.

Finally, the root-level `nuxt.config.ts` combines these layers via [unjs/c12](https://github.com/unjs/c12?tab=readme-ov-file#extending-configuration)'s `extends` keyword:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    './base',
    './blog',
    './home',
  ]
})
```

Note that c12 can also extend from [packages and repos](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/layers#usage) ‚Äì but for the sake of this article, I'm only covering folders.

## Nuxt concerns

Now that you understand how a layer-based site is structured, let's review some specifics for Nuxt's concerns to work correctly under this new paradigm:

- [Framework folders](#framework-folders)
- [Pages and routes](#pages-and-routes)
- [Components](#components)
- [Auto-imports](#auto-imports)
- [Nuxt Content](#nuxt-content)
- [Tailwind](#tailwind)
- [Config](#config)
- [Imports and exports](#imports-and-exports)

> Note that this section is effectively a **sanity check** for layer-related configuration, and:
> - sets you up for the [site migration](#site-migration) section which takes you through full layers refactor
> - provides lots of tips and tricks for configuration in general

### Framework folders

#### Layer folders

Core framework folders [within layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers) are auto scanned build the full app.

Additionally, many of these entities can be further modified using [config](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config):

| Folder                                                                            | Config                                                           |     | Notes                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|-----------------------------------------------|
| [`./components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components)      | [`components`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#components) |     | Auto-imported (nested, renamed by default üôÅ) |
| [`./composables`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables)    | [`imports`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#imports)       |     | Auto-imported (top-level only)                |
| [`./layouts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts)            |                                                                  |     | Auto-imported (nested)                        |
| [`./pages`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages)                | [`pages`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#pages)           |     | Generates routes                              |
| [`./plugins`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins)            | [`plugins`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#plugins-1)     |     | Auto-registered (top-level only)              |
| [`./public`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public)              | [`dir.public`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#dir)        |     | Copied to `./output`                          |
| [`./server`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server)              | [`serverDir`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#serverdir)   |     | Adds middleware, api routes, etc              |
| [`./utils`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/utils)                | [`imports`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#imports)       |     | Auto-imported (top-level only)                |
| [`./nuxt.config.ts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/nuxt-config) |                                                                  |     | Config merged with root `nuxt.config.ts`      |
| [`./app.config.ts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/app-config)   |                                                                  |     | Config merged with root `app.config.ts`       |

This means you can generally break out concerns across layers as you see fit ‚Äì and Nuxt will take care of the loading, registering, and the splicing together of the files.

However, note that same-named files from different layers **will** overwrite each other, i.e. if you have two `<layer>/pages/index.vue` files, then the second layer will overwrite the first.

> ***Note***: I'm going to further investigate the behaviour of overlapping _core_ folders like `public` and `server` as I've had different results in different projects (probably human error!) so check back soon as I'll document my findings.

#### Core folders

Nuxt's default / global folder locations can also be moved to layers:

- [`/assets`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/assets)        
- [`/layouts`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/layouts)      
- [`/middleware`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/middleware)
- [`/modules`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/modules)      
- [`/pages`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/pages)          
- [`/plugins`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/plugins)      
- [`/public`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/public)

However, you will need to, update Nuxt's [`dir`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#dir) config settings:

```ts
// src/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  dir: {
    // core
    assets: 'core/assets',
    modules: 'core/modules',
    middleware: 'core/middleware',
    plugins: 'core/plugins',
    
    // site
    layouts: 'layers/site/layouts',
    pages: 'layers/site/pages',
    public: 'layers/site/public',
  },
})
```

See [Global Concerns](#global-concerns) section for rationale on tidying up your project's root.

#### Programmatic options

Beyond layer folders and config, you have options to add or modify concerns programmatically.

See:

- [Authoring Nuxt Layers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers) for full layers information including support in modules
- [Module Author Guide](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/modules#injecting-vue-components-with-addcomponent) for examples of adding and modifying resources through code
- [Nuxt Kit](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/kit/modules) which provides a set of utilities to help you create and use modules
- [Lifecycle Hooks](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/advanced/hooks) which allow you to hook into teh application build and runtime process


### Pages and routes

Layers can happily contain their own pages and define navigable routes.

However, any `pages` folders must contain **full folder paths** ‚Äì as the layer name is **not** automatically prepended:

```ts
+- src
    +- blog
    |   +- pages
    |       +- blog             <-- route starts here, i.e. /blog
    |           +- index.vue
    |           +- ...
    +- home
        +- pages
            +- index.vue        <-- route starts here, i.e. /
```

<!--
I looked into whether it would be possible using the [`pages:extend`](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/custom-routing#pages-hook) hook, but unfortunately in Nuxt's own internal [`resolvePagesRoutes`](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/blob/main/packages/nuxt/src/pages/utils.ts#L51-L66) function overwrites same-named pages in separate folders. I suspect the only way round this would be a new layer-specific option such as `pagesPrefix`.
-->

### Components

> ***Warning!*** Side-rant ahead! üòñ

Nuxt's components [auto-importing and auto-registering rules](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/components#component-names) are IMHO [unnecessarily complex and opaque](https://stackblitz.com/edit/nuxt3-component-config) ‚Äì and considering this article is about helping you organise your Nuxt app at scale ‚Äì I wanted to comment on what I see as a major anti-pattern, too much magic, and something to avoid.

The thing is, Nuxt's default auto-import settings do scan `components` folders recursively, however:

- **top-level** components import using their given names
- but **nested** components are _prefixed_ with the path's segments

As such, out-of-the-box component "auto-importing" is **also** component "_auto-renaming_":

| Folder             | Component        | AutoImport       |
|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
| `components`       | `Input.vue`      | `Input.vue`      |
| `components`       | `FormsInput.vue` | `FormsInput.vue` |
| `components/forms` | `Input.vue`      | `FormsInput.vue` |
| `components/forms` | `FormsInput.vue` | `FormsInput.vue` |

My problems with this are:

- if you miss this (or misunderstand this) things break real quick
- it's completely unintuitive for any (let alone Vue) developers new to Nuxt
- it's just a workaround to avoid collisions in the global namespace
- it's inconsistent between root and child folders
- you can't organise components without the imported component being renamed
- thus, moving components to subfolders will inexplicably break your app
- then you have to manually find and replace component names in your markup
- you can potentially have _multiple_ components overwriting the _same_ auto-import 
- you don't know what components are used, where, or how many times
- there are no explicit imports for your IDE to track and update
- you lose the ability to navigate to a component via its import
- both VSCode and WebStorm add import statements _anyway_
- ESLint can remove unused import statements if you forget
- it's apparently a [misuse of `d.ts` files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zu-EgnbmcLY) anyway
- it's on by default

Given the above, it's arguable that it _saves_ you any time ‚Äì but can absolutely **cost** you time! And the larger your application gets, the **less magic** you want and the **more safety** you need.

> _I will concede that there are differences in how the two main IDEs support both component navigation and refactoring, and there is no best-fit between the two, as yet. I'm a WebStorm user, so my views are biased due to its superior refactoring abilities._

But with that said and done, your options for component auto-importing are:

```ts
// src/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: [
    // use defaults: use path prefix
    '~/core/components',
          
    // override defaults: no path prefix
    { path: '~/layers/site/components', pathPrefix: false },

    // override defaults: no path prefix, register all globally (for Nuxt Content)
    { path: '~/layers/blog/components', pathPrefix: false, global: true },
  ]
})
```

Note that `components` config supports folder names (useful in layers):

```ts
// src/layers/site/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: [
    { path: 'components', pathPrefix: false },
  ]
})
```

You can also [disable component auto-import](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports#auto-imported-components) entirely, including any default `components` folder:

```ts
// root or layer nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  components: []
})
```

You can also [disable _any_ auto-importing](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports#disabling-auto-imports) but then you lose the benefit of importing the boring stuff:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  imports: {
    autoImport: false
  }
})
```

### Auto-imports

I wanted to cover so-called [auto-imports](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables) functionality, specifically to disambiguate from [components](#components).

In Nuxt, the `composables` and `utils` folders are imported automatically, at least at the [top-level](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables#how-files-are-scanned).

However, there is nothing _special_ about the naming (as in, there is [no enforcement](https://vuejs.org/guide/reusability/composables) of the files within) and you could (should!) add more-specifically named folders, whether-or-not you want them auto-imported. Don't just throw arbitrary code into these folders; if it's `/services`, `/stores` or additional `/config` give it a home to make the intended use _clear_. 

To add additional folders, add them to the `imports.dirs` config, and decide how you want them scanned:

```ts
// src/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  imports: {
    dirs: [
      // add core services
      'core/services',

      // add specific files in core composables in subfolders
      'core/composables/**/*.{ts,js,mjs,mts}',

      // autoload all stores in all layers
      '**/stores'
    ]
  }
})
```

A couple of other things to note about `imports` config:

- it can be an `array` of `strings` (just the paths) or an `object` (additional options; use `dirs` for paths)
- the paths format [supports globs](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/composables#how-files-are-scanned) whereas `components` does not

See the [path configuration](#path-configuration) section for detailed information about how Nuxt handles paths.

### Nuxt Content

Nuxt Content plays nicely with Nuxt Layers.

#### Local sources

You can have more than one content source, meaning you can silo domain-specific content along with its related `pages`, `components`, etc. ‚Äì which might suit if your site has multiple content-driven sections such as Blog, Guide, etc.:

```
+- src
    +- blog
    |   +- ...
    +- guide
        +- components
        |   +- ...
        +- content
        |   +- index.md
        |   +- ...
        +- pages
        |   +- ...
        +- nuxt.config.ts

```

Note that unlike [pages](#pages-and-routes) you **can** configure content without re-nesting the folder:

```ts
// src/blog/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    sources: {
      blog: {
        prefix: '/blog',
        base: './blog/content', // referenced from root
        driver: 'fs',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

#### Remote sources

If you want to include content from a [remote source](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/configuration#sources) such as GitHub, [unjs/unstorage](https://unstorage.unjs.io/drivers/github) makes it possible:

```ts
// src/blog/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  content: {
    sources: {
      blog: {
        prefix: `/blog`,
        dir: 'content',
        repo: '<owner>/<repo>',
        branch: 'main',
        driver: 'github',
      }
    }
  }
})
```

For a private repositories, add your credentials (thanks to [@Atinux](https://twitter.com/Atinux) and [@_pi0_](https://twitter.com/_pi0_) for the [tip](https://twitter.com/Atinux/status/1765059244305383656)):

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    ['gh:<owner>/<repo>', { giget: { auth: process.env.GH_TOKEN }}]
  ]
})
```

Remember to add [your token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to your project's `.env` file or CI settings like so:

```dotenv
# .env
GH_TOKEN=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

#### Content components

Bonus component tip: you don't have to use the suggested [global components content folder](https://content.nuxt.com/get-started/from-v1#global-components) to make components accessible from within Markdown documents, you could also:

- configure _any_ component folder as global using the [components](#components) config `global` flag
- mark specific components as global by renaming them with the `.global.vue` suffix

### Tailwind

At the time of writing, Nuxt's [Tailwind module](https://github.com/nuxt-modules/tailwindcss) does not pick up layers (though it's a [simple](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/going-further/layers#multi-layer-support-for-nuxt-modules) PR).

> Note: [@atinux](https://twitter.com/atinux) tells me this is not the case; I'll investigate and update this section in due course

But you can easily tell Tailwind where your CSS classes can be found:

```js
// tailwind.config.ts
export default {
  content: [
    './core/components/**/*.vue',
    './layers/**/pages/**/*.vue',
    './layers/**/components/**/*.vue',
    ...
	],
  ...
}
```

### Config

There are a few things to think about regarding config:

- where to locate each file
- what each file should contain
- how to correctly resolve paths
- keeping code clean (see [global concerns](#global-concerns) and [tips](#tips))

#### Layer configs

Layers allow you to move domain-specific config to the individual layer config files:

```ts
// src/blog/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: [
    'markdown-tools'
  ],
  markdownTools: {
    ...
  }
})
```

This can be great for isolating domain specific functionality, and at the same time simplifying your root config.

Your final config will be intelligently-merged (via [unjs/defu](https://github.com/unjs/defu)).

#### Path resolution

Note that path resolution in layers can be tricky, because of context, targets and formats:

```ts
export default {
  foo: resolve('../some-folder'),
  bar: 'some-layer/some-folder',
  baz: '~/other-layer',
  qux: './other-layer',
}
```

See the [path configuration](#path-configuration) section in the [site migration](#site-migration) section for a full breakdown of the options.

### Imports and exports

Given that layers are generally self-contained, importing is simplified:

```ts
// src/dashboard/components/User.vue
import { queryUser } from '../services'
```

If you want to import from another layer (and you opted for a [flat](#folder-structure) layer structure) you essentially get aliases for free:

```ts
// src/profile/components/User.ts
import { queryUser } from '~/dashboard/services'
```

Otherwise, you can set up [aliases](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#alias) manually:

```ts
// src/layers/profile/components/User.ts
import { queryUser } from '#dashboard/services'
```

If you want to expose only certain dependencies from a layer, consider an index file:

```ts
// src/dashboard/index.ts
export * from './services/foo'
export * from './utils/bar'
```
```ts
// src/profile/components/User.ts
import { queryUser } from '~/dashboard'
```

And regarding [auto-imports](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/concepts/auto-imports) ‚Äì remember they only import  `components`, `composables` and `utils` folders.

You may need to configure additional imports using [`config.imports.dirs`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#dirs).


## Site migration

So you now understand the concepts, you have an idea of the updates to make, but you need a plan to do it.

Below, I've outlined my best advice, including:

- [Folder structure](#folder-structure)
- [Global concerns](#global-concerns)
- [Path configuration](#path-configuration)
- [Migration steps](#migration-steps)
- [Tips](#tips)

### Folder structure

The first thing to decide when migrating your site to layers is your ideal folder structure.

You can move some or all concerns to layers:

<div style="overflow-x: auto;">
<table style="margin: 0 !important">
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Partial</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Hybrid</th>

I prefer the flat or hybrid structure, as it significantly de-clutters the project outline.

### Global concerns

#### Folders

As outlined above, you might consider moving infrequently-accessed concerns to a `base` or `core` layer:

```
+- src
    +- core
    |   +- middleware
    |   +- modules
    |   +- plugins
    |   +- utils
    +- ... 
```

If a concern spans multiple domains, or isn't specific enough to get its own domain, `site` feels like a nice bucket:

```
+- src
    +- ... 
    +- site
        +- assets
        |   +- ...
        +- components
        |   +- Footer.vue
        |   +- Header.vue
        +- pages
        |   +- about.vue
        |   +- contact.vue
        +- public
        |   +- ...
        +- ...
```

#### Config

Moving infrequently-accessed config to layers makes it easier to get and stay organised (see [tips](#tips) for more suggestions!):

```ts
// src/core/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  runtimeConfig: { ... },
  modules: [ ... ],
  plugins: [ ... ],
  nitro: { ... },
  ...
})
```

Note that if you move default folders you will need to reconfigure Nuxt's [dir](#core-folders) config.

### Path configuration

The correct path configurations (**target** and **format**) are _critical_ to Nuxt locating refactored layer-based concerns.

#### A review of Nuxt's path-related config

Nuxt's path config options can be driven by a variety of path formats:

| Type           | Code                                | Notes                                   |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Absolute       | `Path.resolve('layers/some-layer')` | You can also use `import.meta.url`      |
| Root-relative  | `layers/some-layer`                 |                                         |
| Layer-relative | `some-folder`                       | Relative to `some-layer/nuxt.config.ts` |
| Alias          | `~/layers/some-layer`               | Expands internally to absolute path     |
| Glob           | `some-layer/**/*.vue`               | Expands to an array of paths            |

Additionally, some config options scan **nested** folders, providing glob-like functionality.

Here's a sample of the differences between some of [25+ path-related](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-utils#nuxt-config) config options (along with their quirks):

| Name                                                             | Abs | Root-rel | Layer-rel | Alias | Nest | Glob | Notes                                                             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|:---:|:--------:|:---------:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|-------------------------------------------------------------------|

| [`dir.*`](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#dir)             |  ‚óè  |    ‚óè     |           |       |      |      |                                                                   |

#### Advice on configuring paths

There is also the question of _where_ to configure your paths; in the **root** and/or **layer** configuration?

I think for **smaller** sites, it's fine to configure paths in the layer config.

But for **larger** sites, I've come to the conclusion that ***it's just simpler to configure all path-related config in the root***:

- you're not searching through multiple folders and layer config files
- it's easier to compare and copy/paste paths between options
- path resolution is consistent between layers of differing depths
- you limit any repetition or duplication to a single file

As such, your core `nuxt.config.ts` file might look something like this:

```ts
import { resolve } from 'pathe'

export default definedNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    'core',
    'layers/blog',
    'layers/site'
  ],

  alias: {
    '#core': resolve('core'),
    '#blog': resolve('layers/blog'),
    '#site': resolve('layers/site'),
  },

  dir: {
    assets: 'core/assets',
    modules: 'core/modules',
    middleware: 'core/middleware',
    public: 'layers/site/public',
  },

  components: [
    { path: '~/layers/site/components', pathPrefix: false }, // disable path-prefixing
  ]
})
```

Although this looks a little repetitive and verbose ‚Äì it is much easier to debug with paths in one place.

To simplify and have the correct config generated automatically, use [Nuxt Layers Utils](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-utils):

```ts
{
  extends: layers.extends(),
  alias: layers.alias(),
  ...
}
```

See the [Tips](#tips) section for a full example.

### Migration steps

#### Overview

Migrating an existing site isn't difficult, but it can be a little risky and frustrating. 

You should treat it like any other major refactor and aim to go slow; migrate feature-by-feature, folder-by-folder, or file-by-file ‚Äì as your build **will** break ‚Äì and there will be times when you don't know why.

Set aside a few hours for a small site, and a day or more for a larger, in-production one.

> You can review the [demo](#demo) at the end for a real-world example

#### Steps

Before you start:

- review key [Nuxt concerns](#nuxt-concerns) to get a good overview of each
- create a `migration` branch to isolate your updates from your working code

Make a plan to work on:

- global concerns, such as `base`
- specific domains, such as `blog`, `home`, etc 

To start:

- create aliases for all layers
- use an IDE like Webstorm which rewrites your paths as you move files
- run the app in `dev` mode, so you can see when changes break the app

Then, tackle a single domain / layer at a time:

- create the new layer:
  - add a top-level folder
  - add the `nuxt.config.ts`
  - update the root `alias` hash (so that moves are rewritten using aliases)
  - update the root `extends` array
- move concerns so that you're only likely to break one thing at a time:
  - [Config](#config):
    - moving settings and modules should be straightforward
    - some configuration (i.e. [`dir`](#global-concerns), [`content`](#nuxt-content)) may need reconfiguring
  - [Pages](#pages):
    - remember routes are not prefixed with the layer name
    - check file imports as you move 
  - [Components](#components):
    - if imported, review paths
    - if auto-imported, should just work (unless components themselves moved to sub-folders!)
    - if not, you may need to add specific components folder paths to the `components` config
  - [Content](#nuxt-content)
    - decide whether [Nuxt Content]() will be global or local
    - remember Nuxt Content components need to live in `components/content`
- the things to check as you move are:
  - [Paths](#config):
    - remember `Path.resolve()`'s context whilst consuming `config` is your project's root folder
    - layer-level paths may still need to be `./<layer>/<concern>` vs `./<concern>`
  - [Imports](#imports-and-exports):
    - global imports may flip from `~/<concern>/<domain>` to `~/<layer>/<concern>`
    - local imports may become `../<concern>`
  - [Config imports](#consider-layer-helpers):
    - config `import` statements **cannot** use path aliases; you may need to use `../layer/concern`

#### Points to think about

As you make changes:

- restart the server _often_
- manually check related pages, components, modules, plugins, etc
- commit your changes after each successful update or set of updates

When errors occur:

- it may not be immediately clear why or _where_ the error happened (i.e. Nuxt, Vite, etc)
- make sure to properly **read** and try to _understand_ terminal and browser console errors
- if you find later something is broken, go back through your commits until you find the bug

Gotchas:

- layer config watching is buggy (intermittent at best)
- restart the dev server for missing pages, components, errors
- missing components don't error in the browser (update `components` config)

### Tips

#### Use Nuxt Layers Utils

To simplify path-related configuration, use [Nuxt Layers Utils](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-utils) to declare your layers **once** then auto-generate config:

```ts
// /<your-project>/nuxt.config.ts
import { useLayers } from 'nuxt-layers-utils'

const layers = useLayers(__dirname, {
  core: 'core',
  blog: 'layers/blog',
  site: 'layers/site',
})

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: layers.extends(),
  alias: layers.alias('#'),
  ...
})
```

#### Group related config

Lean on [unjs/defu](https://github.com/unjs/defu) to configure smaller subsets of related options, then merge them together on export:

```ts
// src/core/nuxt.config.ts
const config = defineNuxtConfig({ ... })
const modules = defineNuxtConfig({ ... })
const build = defineNuxtConfig({ ... })
const ui = defineNuxtConfig({ ... })

export default defu(
  config,
  modules,
  build,
  ui,
)
```

For a complete example, check the demo's [core config](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/blob/e022ec2f995128a4287ffa5bbedccbf40ec77594/core/nuxt.config.ts).

#### Consider layer helpers

For complex configuration that may differ only _slightly_ across layers (such as [hooks](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/nuxt-config#hooks)) you might consider helpers:

```ts
// src/base/utils/layers.ts
export function defineLayerConfig (path: string, options?: LayerOptions) {
  const output: ReturnType<typeof defineNuxtConfig> = {}
  if (options.hooks) { ... }
  if (options.thing) { ... }
  return output
}
```

Call from layers like so:

```ts
// src/blog/nuxt.config.ts
import { defineLayerConfig } from '../base/utils/layers'

export default defineNuxtConfig ({
  ...defineLayerConfig(__dirname, {
    hooks: [ 'foo', 'bar'],
    thing: true 
  })
})
```

> Note that you **cannot use path aliases** such as `~` in config `import` statements ‚Äì because Nuxt will not yet have compiled them into its own`.nuxt/tsconfig.json` file.

#### Isolate layers

Use comments or conditionals to toggle layers:

```ts
// src/nuxt.config.ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  extends: [
    './base',
    // './home',
    isDev && './blog',
  ]
})
```

#### Nuxt 2 users

You can use Nuxt Areas to get layers-like functionality in Nuxt 2:

## Demo

So that's a lot of theory; how about some code?

Well, I've taken S√©bastian Chopin's [Alpine](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/alpine/) demo and migrated it from a _concern_-based to a _domain_-based setup.

The idea is to demonstrate a **real-world** migration using the **actual** advice given above.

The tagged [milestones](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/commits/main/) in this migration are / will be:

- `0.1.0` ‚Äì **[Alpine starter repo](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/tree/16f9e7a0a9555d889d236d2f36f8a7f040105d4a)**<br>
  Local content extending external theme
- `0.5.0` ‚Äì **[Combined theme and content](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/tree/8eb099e84d89204466e9ac7c8b3eb74eabc100af)**<br>
  Local content and theme, with a traditional flat folder structure (by concern)
- `1.0.0` ‚Äì **[Refactor to flat layers](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/tree/a9345e527f340c71a5de286a19e19b90edc2d25c)**<br>
  Repackage to core, site and articles layers (by domain)
- `1.1.0` ‚Äì **[Refactor layers to subfolder](https://github.com/davestewart/nuxt-layers-demo/tree/e022ec2f995128a4287ffa5bbedccbf40ec77594)**<br>
  Move site and articles to sub-folder (by domain, but neater)
- `1.2.0` ‚Äì **Refactor using Nuxt Layers Utils** (WIP)<br>
  Migrate path configuration to root (by domain, but simpler)
- `1.3.0` ‚Äì **Advanced layer functionality** (WIP)<br>
  Push layers to see how far we can go!

## Last words

Hopefully this article gives you some solid ideas on how to modularise your site or app ‚Äì and if I've skipped over anything ‚Äì ideas on how to approach it. Layers are generally quite logical and predicable, with a minor tradeoff of a little more configuration.

FWIW I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with Nuxt, so if you think some of this is wrong or inaccurate, do please drop a comment and I can update the article accordingly.

And lastly, kudos to the UnJS and Nuxt team for the work they've done üôè.
