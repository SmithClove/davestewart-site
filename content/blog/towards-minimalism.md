For the last few years I've become increasingly uncomfortable with the concept of "things". You know, the stuff you have in your life which you almost need to define you.

 

Don't get me wrong, I like nice things, I'm just at a point in my life where I've realised that most of them are completely unnecessary.

I'm the sort of person who finds it easiest to concentrate when my mind is empty of distraction, worry, and collateral, and that includes things i.

When I travel, I pack ultra-light. Whereas most people would take a 70 liter pack, I'll aim for a 25 liter pack, 2/3 full. my bag will weigh 6kg, as opposed to 25kg, and I'll take it on with hand luggage.

 

About 7 years ago I bought a flat, and for the first year or so after moving in, it felt empty, so then began the adult quest of filling it with stuff, for many reasons.

Needs

- You need some stuff to live
- You want to be comfortable

Wants

- It's nice to have your own space that you feel you've crafted
- You get bored, or require change
- You're trying to define yourself by your things
- You want to express to the outside world the kind of person you are

Desires

 

Before that I was setting up my own business, and I had 3 computers, a massive IKEA desk system, filing cabinets, etc, etc, and I felt more authentic as a professional, as I had all this stuff to corroborate my story.

 

On gathering crap

- People buy you things, often that you don't need. Coffee table books, trinkets, knick knacks. These are usually non-recycl
- things beget things. You buy this, you need that. That then needs something else, that renders the original "this" obsolete.
- You buy something expensive, or outside your usual style, but it seems somehow lost on its own, so you have to upgrade everything else as well

On de-cluttering

- A lot of stuff can (or should) be reused, and if not recycled
- Some stuff simply has no future past being produced. It would be impossible to recycle, as there are simply too many materials, and they're built in such a way that they couldn't be disassembled easily
- A lot of stuff just didn't last as long as you thought it should. Electronics "go wrong".
- We get a LOT of paper in our lives. Mail. Bills. Statements. Leaflets. Books. Magazines. Newspapers. Packaging.
- We simply don't USE the stuff we buy. Books go unread. Games go unplayed. Objects go unappreciated. Food goes uneaten. Products go unused. It's as if we're in a play, and all the items you see around you are props, simply to help make the story more realistic or believable.

In the ideal world, I would get rid of everything, and just have what I need to live, work and travel.
