# Audit your failures to improve almost anything

## What is an audit

## Purpose

- uncover the truth
- reveal blind spots
- gain insight
- change behaviour

## What to audit

The known knowns:

- project overruns
- bad timekeeping
- lack of progress
- a bad habit
- lack of skill
- shyness

But what about the unknown unknowns:

- what makes you angry
- where do you see others getting ahead where you're not?


## Investigation techniques

### Get prepared

Starting the thing is ...

***Document the facts***: You need to know what the problem is so you know (how, times, impact, etc)
