## Why is estimating hard?

Estimating is hard because you can't predict the future.

Some of the things I've heard or have tried:

- ***Add on 30% for project management.***
  <br>I don't get this at all; firstly, there's no way I do that amount of project management, and secondly, it doesn't cover or tackle the real causes of a bad estimate.

- ***Double or triple your estimate***
  <br>This is actually one of mine, and based on at least a couple of projects I've quoted for, is approaching something accurate – though again – no real insight as to _why_ the original estimate was not fit for purpose.

- ***Double it, then double it again***
  <br>Sounds crazy at first but the initial estimate is the **work**, the first double is the **details and changes**, and the second double is **problems and bugs**. This begins to stack up in my mind, as long as everything _does_ take twice as long; if not do we _triple_? (thanks to [@panphora](https://twitter.com/panphora) for this one)

Note that in the above points I was careful to avoid using the word "overrun".

Overrun implies that the estimate was **sound** and it was the _execution_ that was not.

However, we know this is generally not the case; you don't take on work just to do more, so the **real** problem is being unable to predict what you will need to do, or how long it will take you to do it.

## Breaking it down

Writing the project postmortem I wanted to be honest about my failings, so I looked at various areas:

- the physical tasks I had to do, no matter if planned or not
- how long it took to do things, whether it was more than estimated, and the reasons why that was so
- the times when skill or knowledge couldn't save the day, perhaps it was more about people or process or time

It wasn't long before I noticed a couple of common threads:

- much of the work was the "work to do the work" rather than the "actual" work
- most of the work was under- or un-estimated because it wasn't the "actual" work

***This was in equal parts both **shocking** _and_ **enlightening**.***

I couldn't believe I had been so blind to this, up until now:

- maybe I had considered this unplanned work as just something you have to do
- maybe I thought my attention-to-detail style was somehow my cross to bear

Reflecting on this, I think most likely it's a mix of misplaced professional pride and a level of cognitive dissonance around how quickly I think professional work _should_ be completed, rather than how long it takes to actually complete; I was effectively _ignoring_ the additional time because "it didn't feel correct".

An analogy that sprang to mind was that of [dark matter](https://www.google.com/search?q=dark+matter); it's invisible (like much of a project's work) but by its gravitational influence, scientists know it makes up the majority of the mass of the universe.

But dark matter aside, the upshot is that this effort – my effort – was not being considered, estimated or paid for!

## Building it back up

It was clear that this "happy path" thinking was not only costly in financial terms, but probably explained the various issues I've had with over-running or over-working over the years – at either mine or sometimes my client's expense.

And though the observations themselves felt extremely valuable, they needed fleshing out and pulling together.

Moving forwards, I wanted to:

- start thinking about some kind of "framework" to fit them in or around
- use them as building blocks to break down any future work, maybe even adding timings 
- shine a light on the overall structure and nature of projects, and their estimation 

Building on my notes so far, I shared the observations on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dave_stewart/status/1471451034593771523) and began to think about a structure which represented a typical small-to-medium project's lifecycle:

Consider it a "work in progress" which I will use, adapt and improve going forward.

## Analysis




## Reflection

Again, whilst this currently is not a true representation, it does raise questions regarding the framework going forwards:

- could work be represented proportionally; that is, more complex tasks as bigger squares?
- could there be a formula for the "work between the work"?
- could some kind of checklist provide charts which actually could help with estimation?
- could multiple charts represent cumulative effort by UX, Design and Development?
- how would the shape of charts vary between project, discipline or person?

Whilst I can't answer those questions now, I may attempt to in a future article... or maybe side-project!

There are also many constraints and considerations regarding the _mechanics_ of project management such as project size, team size, project duration and delivery style, but this article isn't the place for that discussion.


## Takeaway

The thing to take away is that a naive estimation of "the work" may only be a fraction of the overall project effort.

Additionally, using some kind of structure (like my document above) breaking down and modelling "the work before / between / around the work" will give you get a much better idea of the tasks you will _actually_ be doing.

I have some additional thoughts on how a framework like this _could_ be used as a basis for a kind of logging and accountability, but again, I will save that for another article.
