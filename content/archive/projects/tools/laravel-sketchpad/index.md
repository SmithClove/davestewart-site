# Laravel Sketchpad

## Overview

Laravel Sketchpad generates an automatic frontend for your Laravel controllers.

In the same way that Markdown is transformed to HTML, Sketchpad transforms the structure of your controller folders, methods, parameters and PHPDoc comments into an intuitive menu system, UI controls and output.

It also live-reloads, so updating the PHP instantly updates the UI!

This allows you to quickly build powerful multiple small tools which leverage backend functionality, but with a fully-functioning, automatically generated UI, to quickly test ideas or create useful tools â€“ in a fraction of the time of building a proper application.

The [full demo](http://sketchpad.davestewart.io/sketchpad) is currently offline, but you can check out the repos:

- [Sketchpad](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad)
- [Reload](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-reload)
- [Simple demo](https://github.com/davestewart/laravel-sketchpad-demo)

_I can't promise that they will work in the latest version of Laravel!_
