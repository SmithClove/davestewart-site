# Application Extensions

## Overview

Extending applications took a bit more work than web frameworks but was extremely rewarding.

You can see them in my old site [here](https://davestewart-io.vercel.app/all/extensions/) or browse below...


## Extensions

### After Effects

[Adobe After Effects](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/aftereffects.html) is the backbone of many a small animation studio. I was an experienced After Effects scripter and wrote various tools to link [3dsmax](../3dsmax/) and After Effects:

- **After Effects Tracker**<br>
  Export 3dsmax objects' tracking data (4-corner pin, 2 point track, position) directly to After Effects

### Komodo

[Komodo IDE](https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-ide/) used to be my IDE of choice. I wrote a couple of fairly advanced extensions in JavaScript and XUL:

- **Komodo xJSFL**<br>
  Komodo extension that supports the JSFL language and xJSFL framework
- **Komodo AutoCode**<br>
  Adds some extra functionality to Komodo IDE, that makes it easier to write code

### Microsoft Office

[Microsoft Office](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/microsoft-office) is simply the default on most Windows PCs. I wrote tools in VBA 6 as and when I needed them: 

- **Outlook Rules Manager**<br>
  Outlook add-on to bulk-manage adding and removing parameters to Outlook Rules sets
- **Excel Data Exporter**<br>
  Excel add-in to manage, export, and combine data to a variety of programmer-friendly formats
- **Excel export delimited text macro**<br>
  Export Tab-delimited text from Excel
