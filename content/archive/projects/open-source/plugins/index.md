# Web framework plugins

## Overview

Before specialising in Vue JS, I wrote a wide variety of plugins and extensions for a variety of JavaScript and PHP frameworks.

Most of this code is no longer relevant as older frameworks have been superseded by newer ones, and as I don't want to clog up this site unnecessary detail, here's just a summary of what once was. 

You can see them in my old site [here](https://davestewart-io.vercel.app/all/plugins/) or browse below...

## Frontend

### jQuery

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) was the glue that held interactive websites together whilst browser manufacturers refused to agree on open standards and released incompatible document object models.

I wrote a wide variety of jQuery plugins in my everyday work from mid to late 2000s.

- **jQuery ThreeSixty**<br>
  Mobile-ready, 360-degree image preview plugin
- **jQuery Log**<br>
  Logs properties and debugging information about the current jQuery collection
- **jQuery Placeholder**<br>
  Provides HTML5 placeholder functionality for IE9 and below
- **jQuery HashSync**<br>
  Provides functionality to synchronise page content with the current URL hash
- **jQuery TabSize**<br>
  Provides consistent visual tab sizes across browsers for code views
- **jQuery Lorem**<br>
  Populates elements with sample Latin text
- **jQuery Hierarchy**<br>
  jQuery plugin to manage and filter a hierarchy of elements
- **jQuery Highlight**<br>
  Highlight a form fieldâ€™s parent tag (or any other selector) as you tab into it.
- **jQuery Populate**<br>
  Populate a form or an element's child elements using a JSON object.


### Vanilla

[Vanailla Forum](https://vanillaforums.com/) is a simple but effective forum platform.

I wrote various plugins whilst developing xJSFL to make my own use of the forum easier:

- **Vanilla SimpleMCE**<br>
  A version of TinyMCE that requires minimal configuration but provides ample options
- **Vanilla Category Buttons**<br>
  A more visual alternative to the default Categories dropdown that ships with Vanilla
- **Vanilla Restore Draft**<br>
  A more user-friendly implementation of Vanilla's default "draft" functionality


### GSAP

[Greensock](https://greensock.com/) animation platform is still one of the most developer-friendly and best performing animation options out there.

I wrote a couple of frameworks to get even more out of the platform:

- **GSAP Scene Manager**<br>
  JavaScript framework to enable easy set-up and management of "story-style" animations
- **GSAP Controller**<br>
  Animation controller for the GreenSock Animation Platform


## Backend

### Kohana

[Kohana](https://kohanaframework.org/) was a PHP framework that found popularity after CodeIgniter waned and before Laravel stole the show:

I wrote a variety of Kohana 2.2 modules between 2006 and 2008:

- **Kohana Downloader**<br>
  A zip-and-download helper for directories
- **Kohana AutoView**<br>
  Maps method-less URLs to corresponding views
- **Kohana Nav**<br>
  A complete package to automatically configure, build and style all kinds of menus and site navigation
- **Kohana HTML Table**<br>
  Powerful library to build HTML table elements from database results
- **Kohana Mailer**<br>
  Powerful HTML to email module that takes the pain out of emailing
- **Kohana Stats**<br>
  Developer-centric module that records and displays benchmark results
- **Kohana Librarian**<br>
  Enables the grouping of related classes under subfolders for easier management and autoloading
- **Kohana: Default controller for serving static pages**<br>
  Save development time by routing un-routable content to default views
- **Kohana FileSystem helper**<br>
  A robust helper to handle everything file and folder-related within Kohana


### WordPress

[WordPress](https://wordpress.com). Say no more.

- **WordPress Flexible Configuration**<br>
  Flexible array-based configuration for WordPress sites that need to run on a variety of hosts simultaneously
- **WordPress Page Redirect template**<br>
  Have any page in the Wordpress "Pages" list invisibly redirect to a static page or other url
