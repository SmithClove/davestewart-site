# Angry Tennis Birds

## Overview

Let's face it: grunting tennis players are _incredibly_ annoying, and it seems to be getting more and more common in the women's game. So in the spirit of "if you can't beat them, join them" I created this mash-up to vent some of my vexation, write some fun code, have a giggle, and share with the world.

The app allows the user to "Angry Birds-ize" any external website, such as BBC Tennis, and "play along" to live tennis games using their keyboard, which trigger the comedic sounds from the Angry Birds games.

Playing [Angry Tennis Birds](https://atb.davestewart.io/) makes any tennis match a fully interactive experience, with separate effects for shots (back-swing and fore-swing), victories, and crowd noises!

## Implementation

The HTML5 Google Chrome release of Angry Birds effectively open-sourced the game assets, so it wasn't too much of a stretch to use them in a mash-up.

The app is run on external sites using a JavaScript injection via a JavaScript bookmarklet, dragged from an original source on the Angry Tennis Birds website.

The application itself is JavaScript, with a tiny visual front-end, and – as of 2022 – HTML 5 audio.

## Press

Interestingly, after releasing Angry Tennis Birds at the start of the 2011 Wimbledon championship and publicising it as much as I possibly could on twitter, facebook, and via friends, a week or so later an article appeared in the Sun newspaper titled "Angry Birds - Grunting girls noisier than creatures on app" :

I emailed the paper subsequent times... but as soon as the topic came up, communication stopped. Read into that what you will!

## Updates

### 2020

Interestingly, an [Angry Birds Tennis](https://www.pocketgamer.com/angry-birds-tennis/angry-birds-tennis-launches-into-early-access-for-ios-for-a-limited-time-only/) game launched on iOS in February 2020, but the title was [cancelled](https://www.pocketgamer.com/angry-birds-tennis/angry-birds-tennis-is-no-more-after-rovio-cancels-the-game-following-an-unsucces/) in October of the same year. Hardly surprising with the amount of exposure and how long it's been in the public consciousness, but it looks like the Angry Birds franchise has probably [had its day](https://www.pocketgamer.com/angry-birds-2/opinion-the-rise-and-fall-of-angry-birds/).

### 2022

The "birds" angle probably hasn't aged too well, but Angry Tennis Birds was always fun to play, so I've updated the code to run in modern browsers.
