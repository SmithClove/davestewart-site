# The Truth About Love

## Overview

Titles for a mid-naughties rom-com starring Jennifer Love Hewitt, Dougray Scott based around a love note written on back of a radish packet, and posted in the mailbox.

Depending on which review site you look at it got either middling-to-good or middling-to-poor reviews.

Anyway, it was great fun to do, and great to see it on the big screen!

## Implementation

Keyframed particles and camera moves in 3DS Max.
