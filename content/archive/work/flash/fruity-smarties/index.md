# Nestle: Fruity Smarties Flash game

## Overview

Fruity Smarties was a tile-based ActionScript 2 game developed as part of a wider above-the-line campaign to launch the new brand. The campaign tag line was "seriously mixed-up", as colours and flavours would not always match up. The game levels mirrored the TV advertising campaign, with topsy-turvy seasons, scenarios, and situations.

## Implementation

Working for Grand Union in a small team, I was the Flash coder responsible for developing the game design and game play.

Coding concepts included movement, AI, collision detection, path-finding, depth-swapping, walk cycles, level editor, and tracking.

Character animation was by [Olly Montague](http://ollym.com).
