# Processr

## Overview

**Processr** is an interactive tool designed to **transform source text from one form into another**, via a **series of user-defined instructions**.

## Usage

It can be used to transform a _simple_ source, such as a few words, into something more complex like:

- [An HTML select element](http://processr.com/#/use?path=Languages/HTML/HTML%20select%20element%20from%20words)
- [A JavaScript data structure](http://processr.com/#/use?path=Languages/JavaScript/Data/Words%20to%202D%20Array)
- [A full AS3 class](http://processr.com/#/use?path=Languages/AS3/Create%20AS3%20class)

Or, to take a _complex_ source, such as an entire document, and transform it into something simpler such as:

- [Reformatting messy source code](http://processr.com/#/use?path=Languages/HTML/Utility/Re-indent%20spaced%20code%20with%20tabs)
- [Cleaning up Microsoft Word HTML](http://processr.com/#/use?path=Languages/HTML/Utility/Clean%20up%20MS%20Word%20formatting)

It really is up to you; Processr just provides the interface, tools and environment to do it.

## Processr Beta

The Beta release of Processr will feature user accounts and a functional back-end.
