# State Machine

## Overview

State Machine is a library for managing a finite set of states, and moving between them via actions and transitions.

From its intuitive configuration through its powerful event-based architecture and rich API, State Machine makes it easy to describe and manage interaction with complex state-dependent systems like components, multi-step forms, purchase funnels, visualisations or games.

The demo above shows-off many of StateMachine's features. Visit the [site itself](http://statemachine.davestewart.io) and view the source code and console for more info.
