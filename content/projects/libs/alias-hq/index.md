# Alias HQ

## Overview

Many languages have the concept of path "aliases" which is way to shorten paths relative paths using simple identifiers, traditionally starting with `@`, for example:


```
'@services/foo' <= '../../../core/services/foo' 
```

They are widely supported in the JavaScript ecosystem, *however*:

- libraries have incompatible formats so require separate configurations
- maintaining duplicate configurations is fiddly and error-prone
- migrating source code is laborious and long-winded
