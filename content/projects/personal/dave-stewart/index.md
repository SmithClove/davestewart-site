# Dave Stewart

## Overview

Content-driven, static Vue site, with an emphasis on simplicity, discovery and interaction.

The site aims to balance putting newer [product](/products/) and [project](/projects/) work front and center, whilst making [older](/archive/) work easy to find, browse and appreciate.

Creatively, the look is simple, modern and fresh. Technically, it's snappy interaction and more of an app-like feel than a traditional site.

## Detail

The site's engine is [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), rendering nested project folders of markdown and images, and hosted on Netlify.

It runs a fully custom theme, with feature highlights including:

- **Content**: optional folder indexes with tree, list and thumbnail views

- **Search**: text, tag and date filtering with date and tree views

- **Media**: gallery, image, video, and website embeds

- **Gallery**: intuitive mouse & keyboard navigation with full-screen presentation mode

- **Navigation**: breadcrumb and sibling links with additional keyboard shortcuts

More information about the technology choices, build, technical and creative decisions can be found in the accompanying [blog post](/blog/technical/building-on-vuepress/).
