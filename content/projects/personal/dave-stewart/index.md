# Dave Stewart

## Overview

Content-driven, static Vue site, with an emphasis on simplicity, discovery and interaction.

The site aims to balance putting newer [product](/products/) and [project](/projects/) work front and center, whilst making [older](/archive/) work easy to find, browse and appreciate.

Creatively, the look is simple, modern and fresh. Technically, it boasts snappy interaction and a more app-like feel than a traditional site.

## Detail

The site's engine is [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), rendering nested project folders of markdown and images, and hosted on Vercel.

It runs a fully custom theme, with feature highlights including:

- ***Content***: optional folder indexes with tree, list and thumbnail views
- ***Search***: text, tag and date filtering with date and tree views
- ***Media***: gallery, image, video, and website embeds
- ***Gallery***: intuitive mouse & keyboard navigation with full-screen presentation mode
- ***Navigation***: breadcrumb and sibling links with additional keyboard shortcuts

In 2021 I found more time to work on the site and added:

- ***Navigation***: desktop + mobile, header + footer navigation
- ***Reactions / comments***: courtesy of [Hyvor Talk](https://talk.hyvor.com/) 
- ***Sharing***: links to share to key social platforms

Additionally, new content:

- ***Home page***: new home page with better formatting and work preview
- ***Blog***: an expanded blog with thumbnail navigation and new posts
- ***Bio***: a more informative bio with photo and links
 
The site's code can be found on GitHub.

## Keyboard shortcuts

The site also has some handy keyboard shortcuts.

Projects:

- `Left`/`Right` - cycle through visible gallery posts
- `Shift`+`Left`/`Right` - navigate to sibling posts
- `Shift`+`Up` - go up one folder level

Search:

- `Esc` - toggle search
- `Down`/`Up` - walk folder tree
