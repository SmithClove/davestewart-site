# Branding Experiments

## Overview

Although I spend the majority of my time writing code, I love to jump into PhotoShop, Sketch, recently Figma, and this time After Effects.

Whilst investigating branding options for [Control Space](../../../products/control-space) I came across the idea of overlaying rectangles, which seemed like it might be a clever nod to the *screen-based* work I've always done.

## Implementation

Coming up with a quick overlapping rectangle design in Sketch, opacity and blend modes were used to generate distinct lightness values of the overlaps.

Next, the image was taken into Photoshop and the colours eye-dropped from reference palettes, then tweaked and adjusted manually.

Finally, once colours were decided, completely new overlapping rectangles were created in After Effects, positioned and this time using the Color Map effect, lightness values were transformed to colour to give the final effect.

## Animation

I really didn't spend any time on the animation (I haven't used After Effects in a long time!) but the Color Map setup really works I feel:

<video class="centered" controls>
  <source src="./animation/simple.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Here's one with text:

<video class="centered" controls>
  <source src="./animation/text.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>


## Final thoughts

As you can see from this site and the [Control Space](https://controlspace.app) site, the idea didn't go further than a few experiments, but certainly something I enjoyed, and worth sharing!
