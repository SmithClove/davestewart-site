# Diary of a Rapid Application Build

## Intro

This project documents the un-learning I had to do to get good at building [rapid prototypes](/search/?tags=rapid-build).

As an experienced developer, I'm used to building large, complex sites, with scalable architecture, clean code and best practices. Imagine how surprised I was when all this experience fell flat when [tasked](https://davestewart.github.io/app-diary/#/intro/background) with a 4-hour coding challenge to build a basic [Trello](https://trello.com/) clone:

It turns out that the architectural skills I've spent years building up simply just got in the way when it came to building something fast, and I learned the hard way that to complete the challenge I needed to switch my mindset from army general to street fighter.

## Outcome

"App Diary" (to use its short name!) ended up as a project of two complimentary halves:

- a blog-style [diary](https://davestewart.github.io/app-diary/) of what I learned at each step of building the application
- a tagged [repository](https://github.com/davestewart/app-diary/releases) of the above clone

The project was designed to remind my future self what not to do in these situations in future, and also as a contribution to the community and anyone learning programming and also tasked with a job interview project.

As it happens the project has stood me in very good stead for other rapid builds that I've done since.

Check them out on the [search page](/search/?tags=rapid-build).
